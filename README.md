Notes and files for my home server and home automation setup

As I start this file, my family and I are in the seemingly never-ended process of moving. Just a local move, about 3km, but it seems like as much work (and is taking longer!) that either of our international moves.

With the move, I decided to start fresh with my home automation setup, rebuilding it from scratch and "doing it right" -- or at least, "more righter".

The repo has notes and links because I know that sooner or later, probably sooner, I'll want to redo this (again) and wish I could remember what I did.

## Lights
Most of my HA is about lighting. I like light; I used to design theatrical lighting and I believe that architecture and home decor isn't complete if lighting hasn't been considered. I also belive that a home's basic lighting has to work with or without the controllers. A switch needs to turn a light on or off.  My main lights (every switch in the house) are Lutron Caseta, and effect lighting is Wiz. [Read More](./lights.md)
